## Running the Code Locally

If you want to make a high-resolution or extremely large visualisation, you might run into the limitations of Google Colab. At this point, it is best to run the code locally. If you are comfortable with Python, you can simply clone the repository and use Conda to create an appropriate environment. esired notebook. You can now run the notebook just as in Colab
